# Base
Using a [[Hyson]] tea as a basewhich has a strong, and slightly smoky flavor profile for a green tea

## Additions
[[Spearmint]] - Uplifting, cool, and energizing
[[Lemongrass]] - Bright, citrusy, brings clarity and cheer (unless you are a cat I guess)
[[Rosemary]] - Mental sharpness, protection, a hint of wild edge
[[Elderflower]] or [[Apple pieces]] - sweetness, maybe a little of playful fae-energy.

## Flavor Profile
Clean, crisp, slightly herbal with a fresh breeze of mint and lemon. Think forest laughter and daring shadows.

## Magical Uses
Perfect for study, spell prep, [[fae]] offerings, or when you need to focus with a little twist of fun. Ideal for springtime, [[Air magic]], or [[Mercury workings]].
